This configurable mod increases the number of healing potions up to the value defined by the user. It will override the maximum number of potions you're carrying, regardless of its original value (8 or 12).
You'll retrieve said number by un-installing the mod.

If you buy the "More Healing Potion" perk while using this mod, your stack size won't be increased by 4 but your point won't be wasted since you'll get 12 healing potions if you remove the mod.


How to use :

Install with the latest version of DAI ModManager (currently 0.59).
If you don't click on the "Configure" button, the mod will use the default value, which is set to 20.


Compatibility :

The mod should be DLCs friendly, but please let me know if it's not.
It will conflict with any other mod altering the following file : da3/equipment/items/potions/item_potion_heal
