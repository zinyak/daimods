-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A. Requirements


     Requires a patched version of DAI. If you use an outdated version or have
     updates disabled, don't use this mod. 

     Installing this mod requires the use of the latest DAI Mod Manager which can 
     be downloaded here:

     http://www.nexusmods.com/dragonageinquisition/mods/116

  B. Initial Install

     The 7z archive includes the files:

       Runes4All.daimod

    Extract the 7zip archive to a staging area. I recommend creating the 
    folder:

      C:/DAIxtract/mods

    And extracting it there. 

    Then run DAIModManager

    - The first time you run it, it will ask you for the location of 
      DAI. Normally it is located at:

      C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Dragon Age Inquisition\

    Once the DAIModManager is running, point the Mod Path at the directory 
    you extracted the 7zip to

    [C:\DAIxtract\mods]

    then make sure there is an [X] beside the Official Patch and the mod:

    [X] Official Patch
    [X] RuneWeapon4All

    Click the [ Merge ] button.

    Browse to your Dragon Age Inquisuion update folder. Typically:

    C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Dragon Age Inquisition\Update

    And within it, right click the back ground and create the folder "merged"

    Double click the new folder to enter. Your path should look like:

    "C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Dragon Age Inquisition\Update\merged\"

    Click [ Save ]

    It takes a few minutes. 
    When it is finished, you can equip all runes to every weapon when you start 
    your next game (or load an existing game). 
    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
II. > > > >  UnInstall
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A. Simple

     The simple method is to delete the merged folder:

    "C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Dragon Age Inquisition\Update\merged\"

     However, this will disable ALL mods you have installed and you will not
     be able to load old save games made while the mod was installed. 

  B. Advanced

     If you have other mods, run the DAIModManager, uncheck 
     RuneWeapon4All and recreate your merged folder. 

  C. Faking it

     If this is the only mod you are using and you want to remove ALL mods, but
     want to salvage your old save games, the easy thing to do is delete the 
     Data directory from merged folder:

     [DAI_HOME]\Update\merged\Data

     Then  copy the Data directory from the official patch into your merged 
     directory:

     [DAI_HOME]\Update\Patch\Data  =>   [DAI_HOME]\Update\merged\Data
